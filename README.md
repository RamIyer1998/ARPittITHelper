# Welcome to ARPittITHelper (name pending)

This will be a ARKit app to help users walk through basics of configuring 
their personal devices for use with PittIT services

## Dependencies needed:
- Xcode 10 and above 
- Ruby (Needed for Cocoapods) 
    - system ruby (requires sudo) *or*
    - [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) *or*
    - [rvm](https://rvm.io/)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/#install)

**Note:** Pods are tracked in the repo so you should be able to build without
Cocoapods but we recommend you do have it in case you want to add a framework

## Using the project

Since we are using Cocoapods, you should open the **.xcworkspace** file instead of 
the .xcodeproj file for proper function

So ARPittITHelper.xcworkspace good; ARPittITHelper.xcodeproj bad
